# Plots of interest in neutrino oscillations
Intended for use in tutorials in the Nuclear and High Energy Physics course offered at Central University of Karnataka.
Neutrino oscillations are introduced to the students towards the fag end of the coursework where very little time is available. Due to my involvement in the India-based Neutrino Observatory, I usually take a special interest in these lectures. The aim of the course is to introduce students to terminologies used frequently in neutrino physics like flavour oscillations, mass ordering, sensitivity, exclusion plots etc.

Though my lecture focuses mainly on one equation of interest which is the oscillation probability, the effect of sensitivity and the need for different baselines are not immediately relevant. So, I made simple tutorial sessions in which the students learns the subject by plotting the importants formulas in neutrino oscillations.

The book Fundamentals of Neutrino Physics and Astrophysics by Chung W. Kim and Carlo Guinti is used and the reference to the figure number page number of the plots are given as comments in the code.
